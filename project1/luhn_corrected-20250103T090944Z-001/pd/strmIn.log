WARNING (XSTRM-354): The technology library 'cds_ff_mpt_scl' contains colored data that is incompatible with this version of the translator and should be used ideally with an advanced node version of the translator (for example ICADV12.1). Make sure that you are using the correct version.
WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'Luhn' is attached to the technology library 'cds_ff_mpt_scl'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
